# Seedling Nursery: Backend

This is the backend code of a project whose goal is to automatize most of the process of a reforestation seedling nursery. It will automatize the irrigation, data collection, seedlings, seeds and matrix trees registration, and so on...

This backend code project was started by another person called Igor. I was making the frontend for this project. From now, I will code the back end as well.
